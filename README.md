## CS 504: Data Analytics: Confronting Road Traffic Collisions in Montgomery County

### Abstract
In our recent study, we tackled the pressing issue of road traffic collisions in Montgomery County, employing a comprehensive analytical approach to unearth key patterns and contributing factors.

### Methodology
- **Time Series Analysis with SARIMA**: We adopted the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to dissect the time series data of road collisions. This advanced modeling helped us in capturing the seasonal trends and cyclic variations, offering an in-depth understanding of the temporal dynamics of these incidents.

- **Geospatial Analysis Techniques**: To complement our time series analysis, we implemented geospatial analysis methods. These techniques were instrumental in uncovering the spatial distribution of collisions and identifying accident hotspots, providing a geographic perspective to the problem.

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Our study also included the use of the Random Forest classifier, a robust machine learning algorithm. This model was key in pinpointing the most significant factors that influence the likelihood of collisions, thus adding a predictive dimension to our analysis.

### Key Findings
- **Integration of Analytical Approaches**: By synergizing time series modeling, geospatial, and predictive analytics, our study presented a holistic view of the various elements impacting road traffic collisions.
- **Use of Tableau for Clustering**: We utilized Tableau for clustering methods, which highlighted the presence of consistent subgroup patterns in collision data.
- **Collision Characteristics**:
  - Approximately 72% of collisions occurred at traffic signals or in uncontrolled locations.
  - Around 70% happened in clear weather conditions and on dry surfaces.
  - Nearly half of all collisions involved same direction, rear-end, or straight movement angles.
  - 81% of the collisions were marked as ‘no apparent injury’.
- **ArcGIS Pro Analysis**: Our examination with ArcGIS Pro revealed an interesting lack of correlation between Average Vehicle Miles Traveled (AVMT) and the frequency of collisions.

### Lessons Learned
- **Team Communication and Collaboration**: The importance of frequent team communication was highlighted, especially regarding the use of a central document repository for efficient information sharing and project management.
- **Data Preparation Challenges**: We found that the data preparation phase was more intricate and time-consuming than initially anticipated, underscoring the complexities inherent in handling real-world datasets.
